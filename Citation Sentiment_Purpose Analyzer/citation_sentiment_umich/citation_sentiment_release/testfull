J93-3003	A88-1019	1993	While the use of orthographic and part-of-speech data represents only a fractional improvement over orthographic information alone, it is possible that, since the latter is not subject to transcriber idiosyncracy, such an approach may prove more reliable than orthography alone in the general case	0	And, for text-to-speech applications, it 7 The parbof-speech tagger employed in this analysis <TREF>Church 1988</TREF> uses a subset of the part-of-speech tags used in Francis and Kuera 1982	1	We have translated these for Table 12	0	Note that intensifier corresponds to QU in Francis and Kuera 1982	0	3	1
